CHANGELOG for Close Combat Free.

Quite a lot of basic engine stuff was done before this changelog was created. Some more history can be devised from git sources (although even there, the thing is not complete).

=== === === ===
06.12.2011:
 - ContextMenu is now displayed on double click when no unit is being followed
 - all menus bacgrounds' colours are now parametrised
 - add ContextMenu to BottomMenu on mobile

05.12.2011:
 - parametrized menus, they should look OK on different screen sizes (and densities). Still needs testing,
   but seems to work

03.12.2011:
 - organise files in PWD/gui into neat folders
 - made soldier menu and statu message menu disappear if they are empty
 - add basic terrain info communication
 - add terrainInfo reader to CcfConfig
 - add "cover" property to props
 - make BottomMenu adjust it's size and not obstruct the view. On mobile, the old behaviour is kept
 - add PropRectangle

02.12.2011:
 - rewrote SoldierMenu so that it is based on GridView
 - add Map_tst2, rebuild Map element, begin adding map props (obstacles). First one is HouseBasic_tst
 - add primitive collision detection. It results in the obstacle removing it's top (for example, a house
   roof becomes invisible)

01.12.2011:
 - add CcfConfigSaver
 - add CcfMain (just initial, copy implementation.
   This is likely to be reshaed later)
 - add status message handling
 - change RosterMenu to be GridView-based

30.11.2011:
 - add sliding BottomMenu (pretty crude implementation, but works)
 - add soldier menu
 - add single soldiers within a unit
 - unified infobox viewer
 - made menus automatically unroll on init, if in desktop mode
 - add OptionsMenu - a roll-down from Options in TopMenu,
   where user will be able to choose from: Preferences, Save game,
   Load game, Quit
 - add quit capability
 - changed QMap<QString, QString> into QMap<QString, QPair<QString, bool> >
   in Config classes - this will enable for the future ConfigSaver class
   to be optimised, as it will only update lines that have changed

29.11.2011:
 - add stop to context menu entry
 - make context menu grid based
 - add zoom in and zoom out keyboard binding ('=' and '-' respectively)
 - parametrised SimpleInfoBox
 - add TopMenu (with new ZoomBox, MenuEntry, PopUpArrow elements)
 - add "Follow" to context menu
 - double click on gameArea now stops following

28.11.2011:
 - add SimpleInfoBox to gui - useful for displaying short messages
 - add pause info box
 - add centering view on a unit (when double clicking on roster entry)
 - add unit follow status box
 - add unit following
 - fix order cancelling
 - make OrderMarkers remain visible even when unit is deselected

27.11.2011:
 - context menu now openes on mouse hold in mobile mode
 - double click in roster now opens context menu
 - add config file, it's parser and root context object.
   Adjust QML to use the new config system
 - add default config file as fallback when there are problems in the main
   one
 - add QML scene resizing together with window
 - add zooming to game area
 - context menu is readjusted to show appropriately when game area is zoomed
 - change roster menu into a QML Grid element

26.11.2011:
 - add drag&drop for OrderMarkers
 - add order cancelling
 - add map scrolling
 - add some keyboard shortcuts
 - add active pause

25.11.2011:
 - fix group orders mixing their targets
 - add desktop mode and mobile mode (initial, simple implementation. There are plans to make it much
   more robust)

24.11.2011:
 - move trialengine2d out of trial and into master

20.11.2011:
 - add order markers

19.11.2011:
 - add new type of turret: TurretImage (it is composed of Image elements,
   not Rectangle ones. It has almost the same code, as Turret.
   A common ancestor will probably be created later)
 - add unified path searching (by means of a PWD root property)
 - add group orders (assigning orders to all selected units at once)
 - add unit selection in both game area AND roster

18.11.2011:
 - add initial modularity to tanks. Tanks should be now more easy to modify.
   Creating new tanks should also be easier. This still needs some fixing,
   as turrets are not as shiny, as they could

17.11.2011:
 - add rubber band unit selection, with modifiers

16.11.2011:
 - add unit selection, with support for modifiers

15.11.2011:
 - add smoke implementation
 - fix mixing fire commands by game logic
 - add support for multiple Effect animations playing at the same time
   (using one Timer and multiple Effect.qml objects)

14.11.2011:
 - add moving fast, sneaking movements implementation
 - add generic unit object, move most of the code from test tank
 - add status messages
 - (and all the rest from git, that is everything older than
   commit 35de2ddac6d3118c0bfcd5f86328ca71fe22a1c5)
