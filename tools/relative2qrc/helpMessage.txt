relative2qrc [-i input/path] [-o output/path] [-s] [-n] [-t] [-h] [-d] [-f] [-no-{qrc,core,img,skin}] [--skip]

An application that automatically converts CCF from relative paths to QRC. Useful for building for mobile devices, and generating release builds. By default, it will not overwrite any files.

Commands (unavailable marked with *):
  -i				input folder. Defaults to "." (current)
  -o				output folder. Defaults to "." (current)
  -s	--suffix		suffix to append to old files' names (to prevent overwriting)
*  -t	--temp-resource		also generate tempResource.qrc (needed on mobile devices)
  -h	--help			display this help message and exit. This flag overrides all others
  -f	--force			will force the run. Files will be overwritten without notice
*  --no-qrc			does not generate QRC files (only in-file paths are changed)
*  --no-core			does not generate coreResource.qrc
*  --no-img			does not generate imgResource.qrc
*  --no-skin			does not generate skinResource.qrc
*  --skip			allows to specify which files should not be copied when converting
