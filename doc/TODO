Bugs & fixes:
 - optimise timer running when following a unit (it can be turned off when unit is stationary)
 - change "child" variables in logic into "unit" variables
 - look for memory leaks in CcfConfig set of classes. There might be some
 - there is some strange order mixing when performing group queues
 - look into memory consumption - scenarios are not fully cleared from memory on close

New features:
 - add game menu
 - add campaigns
 - add guns, infantry, trucks
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add Role enum to props. Might be good to create a specialised C++ class for that
 - (maybe) add another hidden image to Map.qml - obstacle map. It would allow for easy
   adding curiously-shaped obstacles, like water etc.
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - parametrize all unit actions (animation durations, acceleration etc.)
 - adjust parameters to be more human-readable
 +/- add FPS counter
 - fragment resources
 - add scenario (map) damages, that gets updated after battle (destroyed tanks, burnt buildings, props
   positions in clusters)
 - make use of Local Storage (essential for NaCl and mobile devices)
 - prevent firing when target is invisible/ obscured
 
 - use QObject bindings added as rootContextProperty to get more dispersed, modular
   C++ architecture (for example CcfSaver as a separate object in context)

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (partially done)
 - parametrize UI to allow easy modding and skins creation
 - add naval warfare
 - add loadable resources (on runtime)
 - add resource wrapper app for modders (for now, relative2qc can do that)
