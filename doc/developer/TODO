Bugs & fixes:
 - there is some strange order mixing when performing group queues
 - look into memory consumption - scenarios are not fully cleared from memory on close
 - double shooting of close targets is still possible
 - order markers vanish on left mouse click

New features:
 - add game menu
 - add campaigns
 - add guns, infantry, trucks
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add another hidden image to Map.qml - obstacle map. It would allow for easy
   adding curiously-shaped obstacles, like water etc.
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - fragment resources
 - add scenario (map) damages, that gets updated after battle (destroyed tanks, burnt buildings, props
   positions in clusters)
 - make use of Local Storage (essential for NaCl and mobile devices)
 - prevent firing when target is invisible/ obscured
 - add a tool that would change licensing headers automatically

 - use shorter signal-slot chains like ones used in AboutMenu where applicable
 - consider unifying ScenarioLogic::placeWaypoint() and ScenarioLogic::performContextAction()
 - add controls to make addin unit groups possible on mobile

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (partially done)
 - parametrize UI to allow easy modding and skins creation
 - add naval warfare
 - add loadable resources (on runtime)
 - add resource wrapper app for modders (for now, relative2qc can do that)
