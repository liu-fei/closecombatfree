/*! \page todo TODO page
Bugs & fixes:
 - there is some strange order mixing when performing group queues
 - look into memory consumption - scenarios are not fully cleared from memory on close (some clues in http://developer.qt.nokia.com/forums/viewthread/14492)
 - double shooting of close targets is still possible (+ other gun reloading problems)
 - visibility detection fails for some props (See tst4)

Code changes:
 - move digitPresses() to EngineHelpers
 - add necessary enums to CcfGlobal
 - make CcfMain into a Singleton
 - go through props in Scenario and decide what can be transferred to C++
 - add units property to Scenario c++, for easy use in code (JS and C++)
 - continue moving Unit to C++
 - consider removing effects container and using the new particle system instead
 - introduce convenience methods for shortening ::invokeMethod() and ::findChild()
 - investigate if CcfTerrain is leaking memory on Scenario change
 - remove scheduledOperation entirely, or at least move it from Unit to aimLine
 - make pointers to frequently used QML objects C++ class members (to save time by
   avoiding searching them constantly with findChild)
 - make sure to use local methods instead of QMO:invokeMethod after transfer to C++ is complete
 - make sure to update obstacle handling so that it uses the superb QQItem::contains
 - make Soldiers in Unit.qml into a c++ attached property somehow. Not easy stuff, but vital
 - find a way to make Soldiers property of units work as intended & be useful at the same time
 - consider moving RosterMenu to c++, too (possible large gains in connecting to Scenario more directly)

New features:
 - add weather system
 - add unit shadows
 - add game menu
 - add campaigns
 - add guns, infantry, trucks
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add another hidden image to Map.qml - obstacle map. It would allow for easy
   adding of curiously-shaped obstacles, like water etc.
 - add AI (well, obviously). Take a look at WarZone's, Wesnoth's AI and at http://eodev.sourceforge.net/
 - add scenario (map) damages, that gets updated after battle (destroyed tanks, burnt buildings, props
   positions in clusters)
 - make use of Local Storage (essential for NaCl and mobile devices)
 - add a tool that would change licensing headers automatically
 - add a "packaging tool" that would clean the repo, and copy it to a separate dir,
   ready for packaging

 - use shorter signal-slot chains like ones used in AboutMenu where applicable
 - consider unifying ScenarioLogic::placeWaypoint() and ScenarioLogic::performContextAction()
 - add controls to make adding unit groups possible on mobile
 - add Ctrl + q as shortcut for Quit

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (partially done)
 - parametrize UI to allow easy modding and skins creation
 - add naval warfare
 - add loadable resources (on runtime)
 - add resource wrapper app for modders (for now, relative2qc can do that)
