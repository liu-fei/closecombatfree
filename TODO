Bugs & fixes:
 - right-click when choosing target cancels the order but also deselects all units - it should not do the latter
 - issuing attack while on move causes the unit to move to fire destination and fire at the same time
 - add error checking to config system (check for invalidity of entries)
 - maximising the window does not cause QML scene to change size
 - optimise timer running when following a unit (it can be turned off when unit is stationary)
 - change "child" variables in logic into "unit" variables

New features:
 - add game menu
 - preferences menu
 - add UI elements:
    + UI mode switch (desktop/ mobile)
    + zoom buttons
    - status messages area
    + unified infobox viewer
 - add campaigns
 - add guns
 - add infantry
 - add trucks
 - add buildings
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add unit destruction and health
 - add map obstacles, buildings, terrain information

 - add per-unit order queues (that is a big one, but might help a lot in the future)
 - add config saver to config
 - add group following
 - add multiple-waypoint move orders

 - make scripts (especially engineActionLogic) less dependant on QML variables and objects
 - add game saving and loading (maybe as a dynamically generated QML scenario/ campaign file?)
 - add 2 sides (player/ opponent), or even leave it open for any number of players
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - parametrize all unit actions (animation durations, acceleration etc.)
 - adjust parameters to be more human-readable
 +/- add FPS counter

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (Qt Creator is fine here, but it has to be checked and probably expanded)
 - parametrize UI to allow easy modding and skins creation

Done:
 + add single soldiers within a unit
 + add soldier's menu
 + make roster more useful on mobile and elsewhere, by making it's view more dynamic:
    + allow for hiding of roster
    AND/ OR
    + add flickability to roster
 + unified infobox viewer
