 +/- move generic tank properties into a C++ QObject
 + add status messages to units
 + add generic unit (with, yes, a status)

 - add active pause
 - add order cancelling
 - make scripts (especially engineActionLogic) less dependant on QML variables and objects
 - add game saving and loading
 + fix order mixing (either add a queue, or make orders more tightly connected with objects)
 + add more fire timers (list-based) - it will be required to have multiple fires/ smoke animations
   rendered OR make all those things unit-based (probably a bad idea) OR make them unit-connected
 - add unit selection
 - try running Effect.qml animations by sending signals, not modifying the object itself
