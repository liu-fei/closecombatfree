Bugs & fixes:
 - right-click when choosing target cancels the order but also deselects all units - it should not do the latter
 - issuing attack while on move causes the unit to move to fire destination and fire at the same time
 - order cancelling seems to be broken after recent changes
 - add error checking to config system (check for invalidity of entries)
 - maximising the window does not cause QML scene to change size

New features:
 - add game menu
 - preferences menu
 - add UI elements:
    - UI mode switch (desktop/ mobile)
 - add campaigns
 - add guns
 - add infantry
 - add trucks
 - add buildings
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add single soldiers within a unit
 - add soldier's menu
 - add unit destruction and health

 - add multiple-waypoint move orders
 - make scripts (especially engineActionLogic) less dependant on QML variables and objects
 - add game saving and loading (maybe as a dynamically generated QML scenario/ campaign file?)
 - add 2 sides (player/ opponent), or even leave it open for any number of players
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - parametrize all unit actions (animation durations, acceleration etc.)
 - adjust parameters to be more human-readable
 - add FPS counter

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (Qt Creator is fine here, but it has to be checked and probably expanded)

Done:
 + move generic tank properties into a C++ QObject (or a separate QML object)
 + add status messages to units
 + add generic unit (with, yes, a status)
 + add unit grouping (with Ctrl + digit)
 + fix order mixing (either add a queue, or make orders more tightly connected with objects)
 + add more fire timers (list-based) - it will be required to have multiple fires/ smoke animations
   rendered OR make all those things unit-based (probably a bad idea) OR make them unit-connected
   (fixed in an yet another way, much better than those)
 + add unit selection
 + add rubber band selection of units
 + make tanks more flexible (make it easier to add new, modified ones based on the existing)
 + add unified path searching (something like $PWD would be nice to begin with), so that different
   components and files can be moved around and found more easily
 + add group orders (example: moving 3 selected units)
 + add unit selection in both game area AND roster
 + add order markers (objects indicating, where a unit is going, firing etc.)
 + change order marker's colour according to the order given
 + move trialengine2d out of trial and into master
 + group orders mix their targets (they do not reproduce their layout from before the order)
 + add drag&drop for OrderMarkers
 + add order cancelling
 + add map scrolling
 + (fixed) order cancelling does not stop animation durations (or something), and they spontaneously restart
 + add active pause
 + game config:
    + keyboard shortcuts
    + desktop/ mobile mode
    + game window resolution, window state (full screen, maximised)
