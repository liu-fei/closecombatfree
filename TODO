Bugs & fixes:
 - right-click when choosing target cancels the order but also deselects all units - it should not do the latter
 - issuing attack while on move causes the unit to move to fire destination and fire at the same time
 - add error checking to config system (check for invalidity of entries)
 - maximising the window does not cause QML scene to change size
 - optimise timer running when following a unit (it can be turned off when unit is stationary)
 - change "child" variables in logic into "unit" variables
 - fix roster status not adjusting size then a long status emerges (especially important on mobile)

New features:
 - add game menu
 - preferences menu
 - add campaigns
 - add guns, infantry, trucks
 - add fuel and ammo caps for units
 - add in-game chat
 - add deployment phase before the battle
 - add unit destruction and health
 - add C++ proxy class, that will organise QML-C++ communication
 - add "tree clusters" or "forests" that automatically generate
   some forest-looking areas
 - add Role enum to props. Might be good to create a specialised C++ class for that

 - add per-unit order queues (that is a big one, but might help a lot in the future)
 - add group following (not needed too much)
 - add multiple-waypoint move orders
 - look for memory leaks in CcfConfig set of classes. There might be some

 - add IFDEFS for debug mode
 - make scripts (especially engineActionLogic) less dependant on QML variables and objects
 - add game saving and loading (maybe as a dynamically generated QML scenario/ campaign file?)
 - add 2 sides (player/ opponent), or even leave it open for any number of players
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - parametrize all unit actions (animation durations, acceleration etc.)
 - adjust parameters to be more human-readable
 +/- add FPS counter

Big ideas for the future:
 - add advanced world map option (something like TripleA or Hearts of Iron, but with option to perform close combat battles
   at will. Also, it shall include more realistic (when compared to TripleA) production, research, movement functionalities)
 - add time compression
 - add multiplayer
 - add per-commander multiplayer (or even per-unit). That is, several people could fight on one side, steering certain platoons,
   and communicating with others about general tactics
 - add online updates and units/maps/scenario/campaign repositories
 - modding tools (Qt Creator is fine here, but it has to be checked and probably expanded)
 - parametrize UI to allow easy modding and skins creation
 - add naval warfare
 - consider using QRC as mod packages for the game

Done (this section gets occasionally cleaned):
