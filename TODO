Bugs:
 - group orders mix their targets (they do not reproduce their layout from before the order)

Fixes:


New features:
 - add game menu
 - add campaigns
 - add guns
 - add infantry
 - add trucks
 - add active pause
 - add order cancelling
 - make scripts (especially engineActionLogic) less dependant on QML variables and objects
 - add game saving and loading
 - add desktop mode and mobile mode (UI will be more mobile-friendly in the second one. Leave option
   to change it by hand in options/ config script)
 - move trialengine2d out of trial and into master
 - add 2 sides (player/ opponent), or even leave it open for any number of players
 - add AI (well, obviously)
 - add keyboard shortcuts
 - add soldier's menu
 - parametrize all unit actions (animation durations, acceleration etc.)

Done:
 + move generic tank properties into a C++ QObject (or a separate QML object)
 + add status messages to units
 + add generic unit (with, yes, a status)
 + add unit grouping (with Ctrl + digit)
 + fix order mixing (either add a queue, or make orders more tightly connected with objects)
 + add more fire timers (list-based) - it will be required to have multiple fires/ smoke animations
   rendered OR make all those things unit-based (probably a bad idea) OR make them unit-connected
   (fixed in an yet another way, much better than those)
 + add unit selection
 + add rubber band selection of units
 + make tanks more flexible (make it easier to add new, modified ones based on the existing)
 + add unified path searching (something like $PWD would be nice to begin with), so that different
   components and files can be moved around and found more easily
 + add group orders (example: moving 3 selected units)
 + add unit selection in both game area AND roster
 + add order markers (objects indicating, where a unit is going, firing etc.)
 + change order marker's colour according to the order given
